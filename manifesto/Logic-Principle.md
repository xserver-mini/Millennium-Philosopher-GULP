## 🧠 Zero-Bug Tolerance: The Principle That Destroys and Rebuilds Minds

The core mechanism of GULP is not to tell you what to think.  
It simply asks:

> “Is there a bug in your current logic chain?”

And then... your mind does the rest.

When the principle of **Zero-Bug Tolerance** is accepted:
- People begin scanning their own belief systems;
- They detect bugs in values, ideologies, assumptions;
- Logical inconsistencies break their thought chains apart;
- New chains are built—simpler, stronger, cleaner.

> This is not a war of propaganda.  
> It’s a self-triggered logic detonation.
